                <p>Born in Helsinki, Finland, on July 3, 1970, Teemu Ilmari Selänne, a k a “The Finnish Flash”, became one of the greatest and most famous hockey players in history. He made his NHL breakthrough in his rookie season 1992-93, and finished his career as the Olympics MVP in Sochi, as a 43-year-old veteran.</p>

                <p>Only ten players have played in the NHL after their 43rd birthday. Only one of them won the league goal scoring race in his first season and stepped away as the MVP of the Olympics, a tournament in which all the world’s best players played in.</p>

                <p>Teemu’s own dream came true in 2007 when he won the Stanley Cup with the Anaheim Ducks, but in the last years of his career, he accomplished something even bigger when he turned himself into a true athlete who doesn’t leave anything to chance.</p>

                <p>Despite all the trophies, awards, and accolades, Teemu is actually best known for his charm, his warmth, and his unique way to meet people. Thanks to his charisma, his passion, and his love for life, he makes friends wherever he goes. Nothing gets him down – not for long anyway – because he simply refuses to have a bad day.</p>

                <p>Maybe it was the Orange County Register that put it best in 1998 when Teemu was up for the Hart Trophy as the league’s Most Valuable Player. They wrote: “Teemu won’t win the Hart Trophy because the Ducks missed the playoffs, but if the award was called the Heart Trophy, he’d be a shoo-in to win it. His positive attitude has made an impression on thousands of fans, and from homeless people to sick children. He always has time for everyone.”</p>

                <p>Teemu has always been the one who stops and chats with fans when leaving the arena while many other superstars get in their their sports cars and drive home. He’s ultrasocial and empathetic, and everyone he meets is important to him.</p>

                <p>It’s as if he was born to be a star. He has always had the characteristics of a star, and that thing, “it”, that creates phenomena.</p>

                <p>All those characteristics are still there. Teemu is still one of the biggest stars of the game, and a great role model.</p>
